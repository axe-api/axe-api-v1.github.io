It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage data between a client and a server. REST APIs are popular because they are simple to use, scalable, and can handle multiple types of data formats like JSON and XML.</p><p>With REST APIs, developers can create applications that interact seamlessly with other services, making it easier to integrate different systems. REST is designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. This makes REST APIs efficient and easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-example-of-a-rest-api" tabindex="-1">What is an example of a REST API? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-an-example-of-a-rest-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is an example of a REST API?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A REST API example is a service that lets applications communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. For instance, a weather app might use a REST API to fetch current weather data. The app sends a GET request to the API, and the API returns the weather information in a simple format like JSON. This makes it easy for different apps to use and display the data.</p><p>Another common REST API example is an online store. When a user browses products, the app sends a GET request to the API, which returns a list of products. If the user adds an item to their cart, the app sends a POST request to update the cart. REST APIs are widely used because they are easy to understand and work well across various platforms.</p><h2 id="what-does-rest-stand-for" tabindex="-1">What does REST stand for? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-rest-stand-for" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What does REST stand for?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a set of rules and best practices for building web services. RESTful services use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on resources, which are usually represented in formats like JSON or XML. This approach allows different systems to communicate over the web in a simple and consistent way.</p><p>REST focuses on stateless communication, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. This statelessness makes REST services scalable and easy to manage. By following REST principles, developers can create APIs that are easy to use, well-structured, and compatible with a wide range of clients, from web browsers to mobile apps.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-api-and-rest-api" tabindex="-1">What is the difference between API and REST API? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-api-and-rest-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the difference between API and REST API?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that lets different software applications communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted, making it easier for developers to integrate various services. APIs are not tied to any specific format or protocol, so they can use different methods like SOAP, GraphQL, or REST.</p><p>A REST API, however, is a specific type of API that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations and typically returns data in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are popular because they are simple, scalable, and easy to use with web services.</p><h2 id="is-rest-always-json" tabindex="-1">Is REST always JSON? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-rest-always-json" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is REST always JSON?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>No, REST is not always JSON. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, and it does not require the use of JSON specifically. While JSON is a popular data format due to its lightweight and easy-to-read structure, REST APIs can also use other formats like XML, HTML, or plain text. The format is determined by the needs of the application and the preferences of the developers.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-language-to-build-a-rest-api" tabindex="-1">What is the best language to build a REST API? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-best-language-to-build-a-rest-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the best language to build a REST API?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When choosing a language to build a REST API, Python is often considered one of the best options.

Additionally, REST APIs can easily work with different data formats like JSON and XML, providing flexibility and making them suitable for a wide range of applications.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-rest-api" tabindex="-1">What are the disadvantages of REST API? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-disadvantages-of-rest-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What are the disadvantages of REST API?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>REST APIs, while popular, have some downsides. They often require multiple network requests to fetch related data, which can slow down performance. Additionally, because REST is stateless, every request must include all necessary information, potentially increasing data transfer and making integration more complex.</p><p>Another issue is that REST APIs can be less efficient for real-time updates compared to other methods like WebSockets. They also rely heavily on HTTP methods, which may not be ideal for every application. This can limit flexibility and scalability in certain scenarios.</p><h2 id="how-rest-apis-work" tabindex="-1">How REST APIs work <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-rest-apis-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How REST APIs work&quot;">​</a></h2><p>REST APIs, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces, allow different software applications to communicate over the internet. They work by using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage and exchange data. This makes it easy for different systems to interact with each other.</p><p>When a client wants data from a REST API, it sends a request to a specific URL. The server then processes this request and sends back a response, typically in JSON format. This response contains the data or an error message if something went wrong.</p><p>REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. This helps in making sure each request is independent and can be handled efficiently.</p><p>One of the key features of REST APIs is their ability to use URLs to access different resources. Each URL represents a specific resource, and the API methods determine how this resource can be accessed or modified. This clear structure helps in organizing and managing data.</p><p>Overall, REST APIs simplify the process of building and interacting with web services. They provide a straightforward way to perform operations on data, making it easier for developers to integrate different systems and applications effectively.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-rest-api-best-practices" tabindex="-1">What are the REST API best practices? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-rest-api-best-practices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What are the REST API best practices?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When designing a REST API, it&#39;s important to follow best practices to ensure that your API is efficient and user-friendly. First, use clear and consistent naming conventions for your endpoints. This means that your URLs should be easy to understand and follow a logical structure. For example, use nouns for resources, like <code>/users</code> or <code>/products</code>, and avoid verbs in URLs since actions are handled by HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</p><p>Second, make sure your API is stateless. This means that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. Avoid relying on the server to store session data between requests. By keeping the API stateless, you make it easier to scale and manage, as each request can be handled independently.</p><p>Third, provide useful and consistent error messages. When something goes wrong, your API should return clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes. For example, use a 404 status code for not found errors and a 400 status code for bad requests. This helps developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it, improving the overall usability of your API.</p><p>Fourth, include proper documentation for your API. Good documentation is crucial for developers to understand how to use your API effectively. Provide clear explanations of each endpoint, including request and response formats, as well as examples. This makes it easier for users to integrate your API into their applications and reduces the time spent on support.</p><p>Lastly, ensure your API is secure by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Use techniques such as API keys or OAuth tokens to control access to your endpoints. By protecting your API, you prevent unauthorized access and ensure that sensitive data is kept safe. This is essential for maintaining trust and integrity in your API services.</p><h2 id="what-is-axe-api" tabindex="-1">What is Axe API? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-axe-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Axe API?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Axe API is a TypeScript-based Node.js framework designed to eliminate the need for repetitive tasks associated with common elements while allowing developers to focus on custom logic.
